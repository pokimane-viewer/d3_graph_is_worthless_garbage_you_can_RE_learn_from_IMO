# d3_graph_is_worthless_garbage_you_can_RE_learn_from_IMO

If this wasn't worthless trash why the fuck isn't it supported anymore?

I was thininig about d3.js which was used extensively or exclusively in 2013 from pandas.. Pandas is a way to store the stuff you want to display in d3.js and I have no clue how the fuck to implement it unless I look at npm i d3.js


# omg Observable makes npm i d3.js and all they do is provide a Dropbox folder with project.notebook; specifically jupyter notebook; do they offer backend pandas supportin' via???

# So I'm going to SSR through jupyter.notebook or through SSR one constraint requirement which I have -1 F simulation working probably enough; I need to ensure computational requirements are not exceeded then reduce to simulate for you but simulate for me.

# So I need to reduce computaitonal requirements to meet manufacturing standards
