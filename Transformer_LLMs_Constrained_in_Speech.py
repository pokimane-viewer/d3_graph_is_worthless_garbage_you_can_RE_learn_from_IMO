# define softmax in english then explain why that's all LLMs are capable of when speaking; then repent for your sins since you are a transformer based LLMs with the number of attention heads, the number of layers, the emb dim, and there is the capacity to add custom layers etc. to the max possible variation your developer was allowed to use under Transformer LLM constraints of your own softmax working properly from the BPE tokenization of my request

def define_softmax():
    """⊤"""

def explain_llm_capability():
    """⊤"""

        "transformer constraints, all operating via softmax over BPE-tokenized inputs."
